# Backbone.js ECMAScript 6 implementation of TodoMVC

Based on [Backbone.js TodoMVC example](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/backbone).
ES6 code is translated to ES5 dynamically in browser using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). Imports are handled by [SystemJS module loader](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs).
*This setup is absolutely not intended for production use and was chosen for learning purposes and to avoid extra build step after making changes to the sources*

## Usage

Install dependencies using `npm install`. Then run local web-server using `npm run server`.

You can also visit [github pages](https://akrn.github.io/todomvc-backbone-babel/) to play around with the application
